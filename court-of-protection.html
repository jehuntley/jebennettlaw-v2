        <h2 id="deputies">Lay Deputies and Professional Deputies</h2>
        <h3>What are they? And what’s the difference?</h3>
        <p>
          A lay deputy is usually a friend or family member of the person who lacks the ability to make decisions for themselves. People may lack mental capacity because, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            they’ve had a serious brain injury or illness
          </li>
          <li>
            they have dementia
          </li>
          <li>
            they have severe learning disabilities
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A lay deputy is usually a friend or family member of the person who lacks the ability to make decisions for themselves. People may lack mental capacity because, for example: 
        </p>
        <p>
          A prospective lay deputy makes an application to the Court of Protection to become a deputy for the person in question and, if successful, is empowered to make decisions on their behalf.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are 2 types of deputy:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            property and financial affairs, eg paying bills, organising a pension
          </li>
          <li>
            personal welfare, eg making decisions about medical treatment and how someone is looked after
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It is also possible for the court of protection to appoint a professional deputy. A professional deputy has virtually identical responsibilities to those of a lay deputy but is a professionally employed person who has the expertise to deal with the challenges of the role. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A professional deputy will work closely with the person’s family at all times, but it is important to note their first responsibility is always to the person they are deputy for.
        </p>

        <h3>Duties as a professional deputy often include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Purchasing a property
          </li>
          <li>
            Arranging for a property to be purchased or adapted to meet the person’s needs
          </li>
          <li>
            The purchase of an adapted vehicle or equipment
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensuring that the person is receiving all benefits that they are entitled to
          </li>
          <li>
            Employing a case manager to oversee a care team
          </li>
          <li>
            Arranging holidays with support staff
          </li>
          <li>
            Preparation of a statutory will (for people aged 18 and over)
          </li>
          <li>
            Submission of annual accounts to the Office of the Public Guardian’s and completion of tax returns
          </li>
          <li>
            Being alive to safeguarding concerns or risks around neglect or financial abuse and the need for best interests decisions or applications for aspects outside the deputy’s authority such as for gifts or loans.  The professional must also be aware of deprivation of liberty aspects and to know how to apply for appropriate authorisations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The team advises on all aspects of Court of Protection work and the role and duties of deputies.  Jane handles deprivation of liberty matters including advising lay deputies around these issues, and what amounts to a deprivation and in what circumstances and where etc.
