      <h2 id="trusts">Trusts for the vulnerable</h2>

      <p>
        Where assets and/or compensation monies require protection either to preserve eligibility for state benefits, or in general, we advise on the full range of trusts for the vulnerable and disabled. Where we act as professional trustee, our team streamlines the administration of the trust, including giving attention where necessary to state benefit claims, and  tax and trust annual returns to Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs.

      <h2 id="deputies">Lay Deputies and Professional Deputies</h2>
      <h3>What are they? And what’s the difference?</h3>
      <p>
        A lay deputy is usually a friend or family member of the person who lacks the ability to make decisions for themselves. People may lack mental capacity because, for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          they’ve had a serious brain injury or illness
        </li>
        <li>
          they have dementia
        </li>
        <li>
          they have severe learning disabilities
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A lay deputy is usually a friend or family member of the person who lacks the ability to make decisions for themselves. People may lack mental capacity because, for example: 
      </p>
      <p>
        A prospective lay deputy makes an application to the Court of Protection to become a deputy for the person in question and, if successful, is empowered to make decisions on their behalf.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are 2 types of deputy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          property and financial affairs, eg paying bills, organising a pension
        </li>
        <li>
          personal welfare, eg making decisions about medical treatment and how someone is looked after
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It is also possible for the court of protection to appoint a professional deputy. A professional deputy has virtually identical responsibilities to those of a lay deputy but is a professionally employed person who has the expertise to deal with the challenges of the role. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A professional deputy will work closely with the person’s family at all times, but it is important to note their first responsibility is always to the person they are deputy for.
      </p>

      <h3>Duties as a professional deputy often include:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Purchasing a property
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          The purchase of an adapted vehicle or equipment
        </li>
        <li>
