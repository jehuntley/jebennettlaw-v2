      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Whether an interim payment or final settlement of a claim, your client needs to be advised how the payment should be managed. Failure to place a settlement into an appropriate trust or jurisdiction could have an impact on your client's entitlement to means tested benefits and local authority funded care.
