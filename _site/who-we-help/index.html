      <h3 id="family">The family of those lacking mental capacity</h3>
      <p>
        Our core business is helping the vulnerable. In practice this often means helping the family of the vulnerable protect their loved ones best interests.
      </p>
      <p>

          Had a serious brain injury or illness
        </li>
        <li>
          Dementia

        <li>
          Severe learning disabilities

      </ul>

      <h3 id="elderly">The elderly</h3>
      <p>
        We also provide a full range of services for the elderly client:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          we offer Enduring/Lasting Powers of Attorney; Wills, and advice regarding care in the home, or the community

      <p>
        The injured party can be someone injured at birth; in an accident; by disease; through old age, third party negligence or by criminal assault.
      </p>
      <h3 id="lay-deputy">The lay deputy</h3>
      <p>
        The lay deputy is someone who has not been appointed as an independent professional, but usually as a family member or as a party who is in some way associated with or in close alliance with the patient.  The lay deputy would not charge for his or her services but would be entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenditure.
      </p>
      <h3 id="lay-trustee">The lay trustee</h3>
      <p>
        The lay trustee is someone who, similar to the lay deputy, is acting as a close family member or in close alliance with the injured party and who requires legal advice as they are not a professional with legal skills or experience.
      </p>
      <h3 id="claimants-pi">Claimants and defendants in personal injury cases</h3>

      <p>
        The claimant in clinical negligence cases will be the claimant litigator solicitor and the defendant will be the NHS Litigation Authority or otherwise the body governing the medical practitioner’s practice.
      </p>
      <h3 id="pi-insurers">PI insurers</h3>
      <p>
        The PI insurer will be funding the litigation action or providing compensation to the injured party.
      </p>
      <h3 id="cica-claimants">Criminal Injury Compensation Authority (“CICA”) claimants</h3>
      <p>
        The CICA claimant is a victim of a criminal assault and as such, is an injured party.
      </p>
      <h3 id="pi-lawyers">Personal injury and private client lawyers (via training)</h3>
      <p>
        The personal injury lawyer is an advisor who specialises in personal injury law in order to pursue or defend claims for personal injury.  The private client lawyer advises on non litigation-related matters, and specialises in any or all of the following legal areas: personal and trust tax and estate planning; Wills and Probate; the law regarding the elderly or vulnerable client.
