      <p>
        We offer a full range of advice to the elderly client, including <a href="#lasting-power">Enduring/Lasting Powers of Attorney</a>; Wills, and advice regarding care in the home, or the community; establishing what the Local Authority can or should be offering you, and how funding problems can be resolved whether it be via claims to the Local Authority or the NHS commissioning body, or both. Where necessary we will also advise you on equity release schemes to the extent that there are implications regarding funding your current/future care.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we offer advice on trusts for grandchildren as a tax-efficient vehicle to plan for the longer term, and where necessary we can act as certificate providers under Lasting Powers of Attorney. We will offer to review your Will where we may be working with you on other matters, as a matter of course.

      <h2 id="community">Community Care Law</h2>
      <p>
        If you find the maze of rules and regulations surrounding funding of residential care home places and/or domiciliary care fees confusing, or you are generally worried about whether you will have to use all of your savings to fund your long term care, we are here to help. The passage of the Care Bill 2013 through Parliament and the forthcoming regulation of state-funding in care homes and at home, and state-funding of care through the NHS is changing things fast. So too are the rules and codes that will apply to local authorities regarding safeguarding.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Do you know what to do or where to turn if you disagree with the decision the local authority or NHS has made regarding your parents’ care and how they should fund it, but feel powerless to help them?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you have an elderly relative who has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983 in the past and you need advice regarding local authority funding for aftercare in their accommodation?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you suspect that your loved one or resident in your care home is being abused – financially; physically or psychologically?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If so, we can guide you through the rules and regulations to get the best possible result to protect your loved ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        We act for private clients and also for care homes who may be facing similar concerns, and we continue to successfully challenge local authority or NHS decisions on funding and/or care.

        <h3>Lasting Power of Attorney or Enduring Power of Attorney?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>A Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)</strong> is a legal tool that allows you to appoint someone to make certain decisions on your behalf. This replaced the Enduring Power of Attorney in 2007. There are two types. The appointed person can manage your property and finances for you and/or your health and welfare. These powers are transferred to the power of attorney in the future should you reach a point where you are no longer able to make decisions for yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA)</strong> is the legal ability to manage someone's property and financial affairs on their behalf. It applies to people who do not have the mental capacity to decide on their financial matters, but must have been set up before they lost mental capacity. EPA’s were replaced by LPA’s in 2007. The most significant difference being that EPA’s did not cater for health and welfare decisions.
