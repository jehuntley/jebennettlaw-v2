        Founded in 2014, JE Bennett Law is a relatively new practice, which is currently expanding and building on its initial success. The founder Jane Bennett has over 17 years’ experience as a private client lawyer, specialising in the law regarding the vulnerable clients for the last 13 of those years.  Prior to founding JE Bennett Law, Jane was a partner at two law firms in the City of London.

        Jane is passionate about helping the vulnerable, and in 2011 made the decision to start her own practice to have the freedom to focus on just that.  Specifically, she wanted to run a firm which could concentrate on the needs of the client, and have the freedom to grow that practice without the burden of expensive overheads. Today at JE Bennett, the team prides itself on offering clients real value and a truly personal service.

        The firm’s core business is about helping private clients on matters regarding the Court of Protection; trusts for the vulnerable, and powers of attorney.  Jane’s particular specialism is in acting as an expert witness in high value and catastrophic personal injury litigation claims regarding the role and costs associated with a professional deputy and related issues.

        The firm acts for those who due to events in their lives/personal trauma, are limited in their ability to manage their own financial and health/care needs.  We also advise their family members, who are often going through an extremely stressful time as a result of trying to fight for their loved one’s rights. This requires considerable expertise, empathy, and commitment to what is a growing and ever more complex practice area.
